# BlockTrance

## Project Description

BlockTrance is a decentralized music streaming and royalty distribution platform built on blockchain technology. It revolutionizes the music industry by enabling artists to upload their tracks, receive instant royalties for each stream, and maintain complete control over their music rights. The platform eliminates intermediaries, ensures transparent payment distribution, and creates a direct connection between artists and listeners.

Using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, BlockTrance automates royalty payments, tracks streaming metrics in real-time, and provides a trustless environment where artists can monetize their work fairly. Listeners pay a small fee per stream, which is automatically distributed to the artist after deducting a minimal platform fee.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize the music industry by:

- **Empowering Artists**: Giving independent musicians direct access to their audience without relying on traditional music labels or streaming platforms that take significant cuts
- **Ensuring Fair Compensation**: Implementing transparent, automated royalty payments that guarantee artists receive their fair share immediately
- **Building Trust Through Transparency**: Using blockchain technology to create an immutable record of streams, earnings, and transactions
- **Fostering Creative Freedom**: Allowing artists to set their own pricing and maintain full ownership of their creative works
- **Creating a Global Platform**: Enabling artists and listeners from anywhere in the world to connect without geographical or financial barriers

## Key Features

### 1. **Artist Registration**
- Artists can register on the platform with their unique identity

- Simple one-time registration process

### 2. **Track Upload & Management**
- Artists can upload unlimited tracks to the platform
- Set custom royalty rates per stream for each track
- Full control over track availability and pricing

### 3. **Decentralized Streaming**
- Listeners can stream any active track by paying the set royalty fee
- Instant payment processing through smart contracts
- Transparent fee structure (5% platform fee, 95% to artist)
- Stream history tracked on-chain for complete transparency

### 4. **Automated Royalty Distribution**
- Real-time earnings calculation and tracking

- Artists can withdraw earnings at any time
- No delays or payment disputes

### 5. **Platform Governance**
